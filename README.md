# Restaurant Management System

The Restaurant Management System is a Java program that simulates the operations of a restaurant. It models various components of a restaurant, such as menu items, waiters, chefs, and tables. The program uses the SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) framework for logging.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- SLF4J library

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code ZIP.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-management.git
Ensure you have Java 8 or a higher version installed on your system.

Add the SLF4J library to the project's classpath. You can use popular SLF4J implementations like Logback or Log4j.

Compile the Java files using a Java compiler:

bash
Copy code
javac Main.java
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
java Main

**Usage**

The Main class contains the entry point of the program. It creates a restaurant, initializes its components, and starts the restaurant simulation.

**Components**

Restaurant: Represents the restaurant entity and contains various properties such as name, menu, manager, waiters, tables, chefs, lease cost per square foot, and area in square feet. It also has methods to start the restaurant and handle operations related to orders and table management.

Menu: Represents the restaurant's menu and holds references to different food items like starters, main courses, desserts, and drinks.

Manager: Represents a manager in the restaurant. It holds properties like name and is part of table management.

Waiter: Represents a waiter in the restaurant. It holds properties like name, years of experience, and a reference to a shared order queue (BlockingQueue<Order>).

Chef: Represents a chef in the restaurant. Similar to the waiter class, it holds properties like name, years of experience, and a reference to the shared order queue (BlockingQueue<Order>).

Table: Represents a table in the restaurant and is used to assign waiters and managers to each table. The number of seats at the table is specified as well.

**Functionality**

The program creates a restaurant named "Mingi Chow" and sets up its menu, manager, waiters, chefs, and tables.
The waiters take orders from customers and place them in the shared order queue.
The chefs pick up orders from the order queue and prepare the food items.
Once the food is ready, the waiters serve it to the respective tables.
The restaurant simulation runs until all orders are processed or the program is terminated manually.

**Logging**

The program uses SLF4J for logging. Ensure that you have an appropriate SLF4J implementation (e.g., Logback or Log4j) set up to view the log messages generated by the program.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
